### Miscellaneous

・ISHII (石井) is a popular surname. Shun (竣) is also common, but the corresponding kanji is rarely used for names. Since there are many similar kanjis with same pronunciation (eg. 駿, 俊, 峻, 浚, 悛, ...), please be careful when you cite my name.

・Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, hiking in mountains and taking pictures.

・[Here](/book) are some of my favorite books. Unfortunately, most of them are available only in Japanese.

・Some of my (past) colleagues around the same age : [Naganori Yamaguchi](https://n-yamaguchi-0729.github.io/homepage-jp), [Yota Maeda](https://yota-maeda.vercel.app) and [Séverin Philip](https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sphilip/).
