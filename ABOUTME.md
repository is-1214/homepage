・ISHII (石井 in kanji) is a popular surname. Shun is also common, but the corresponding kanji "竣" is rarely used for names. This kanji roughly means "to construct something".

・Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading novels, hiking in mountains, taking pictures and playing [Splatoon 3](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/av5ja/index.html).
