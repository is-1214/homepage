## Free Space

・ISHII (石井) is a popular surname. Shun is also common, but the corresponding kanji 竣 is rarely used for names. Since there are many similar kanjis with same pronunciation (eg. 駿, 俊, 峻, 浚, 悛, ...), please be careful when you cite my name in kanji.

・Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading novels/comics, hiking in mountains and taking pictures.

・Some of my favorite novels and comics : 告白 (Confession) by 町田康 (Ko Machida), 青い花(Sweet Blue Flowers) by 志村貴子 (Takako Shimura) and 見えない都市(Le città invisibili) by Italo Calvino.

・Some of my (past) colleagues around the same age : [Naganori Yamaguchi](https://n-yamaguchi-0729.github.io/homepage-jp), [Yota Maeda](https://yota-maeda.vercel.app) and [Séverin Philip](https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sphilip/).
