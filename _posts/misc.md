### Miscellaneous

・ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun (竣) is also common, but the corresponding kanji is rarely used for names. Since there are many similar kanjis (eg. 駿, 俊, 峻, 浚, 悛, ...), please be careful when you cite my name.

・Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, keeping a diary, hiking in mountains and taking pictures. [Here](/book) are some of my favorite books. Unfortunately, most of them are available only in Japanese.
