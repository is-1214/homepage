### Miscellaneous

- ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun is also common, but the corresponding kanji (竣) is rarely used for names. The only example I know of this character being used in everyday language is the word 竣工 (or 竣成), which means completion of construction.

- Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, keeping a diary, hiking in mountains and taking pictures. I introduce some of my favorite books at [this page](/books). You can find some photos I took [here](/photos) (**Warning!** the page won't open since the photo files are too large).
