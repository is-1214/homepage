### Miscellaneous

- **(My name)** ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun is also common, but the corresponding kanji (竣) is rarely used for names. 竣 roughly means ``construct (or complete) something''.

- **(My rule)** I sometimes avoid drinking alcohol and over-crowded places due to certain reasons. I am sincerely sorry in advance that I might refuse your kind invitations because of these.

- **(Non-mathematical interests)** Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, keeping a diary, hiking in mountains and taking pictures. I introduce some of my favorite books at [this page](/books). You can also find some photos I took [here](/photos) (**Warning!** the page won't open since the photo files are too large).
