### Miscellaneous

・ **(my name)** ISHII (石井) is a popular surname in Japan. Shun is also common, but the corresponding kanji (竣) is rarely used for names. Since there are many similar kanjis (eg. 駿, 俊, 峻, 浚, 悛, ...), please be careful when you cite my name (注記 : 書類上の手続きにて誤った名前が記載されていると不備が生じ得るため, その場合にはお手数をお掛けしますが訂正をお願いする可能性があります).

・ **(my rule)** I sometimes avoid drinking alcohol and over-crowded places due to (not so serious) health reasons. I am sincerely sorry in advance that I might refuse your kind invitations because of these.

・ **(my favorite things)** Other than mathematics, I enjoy reading books, keeping a diary, hiking in mountains and taking pictures. I introduce some of my favorite books [here](/books). [Here](/photos) are some photos I took.
