I am Shun ISHII, a JSPS research fellow at Keio University, working with Prof. [Kenichi Bannai](https://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~bannai/en/). Before coming to Keio, I was a doctoral course student at Kyoto university under the supervision of Prof. [Akio Tamagawa](https://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/list/TAMAGAWA,%20Akio.html).

[This](/cv) is my CV, and [here](/talks) is the list of my talks.

**email address**: ishii(dot)shun(at)keio.jp

**Research interests**:

- Once-punctured elliptic curves (Galois actions on π_1, elliptic MZVs, elliptic GT group, etc)

- Abelian varieties and Drinfeld modules

- Anabelian geometry and related topics
